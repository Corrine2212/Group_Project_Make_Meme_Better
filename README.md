## Project Description:
### What does the application do?
This was our first group project in which we were tasked to create a full stack application. We chose to build a social media app with a focus on mental health positivity. 
Users can... 
- login to an account
- create and delete a post
- update their post
- delete their profile
- comment on other posts with gifs

### Technologies used and why?
- For 4/5 weeks we've been learning to build full stack apps using:
  - Javascript
  - React
  - PostgreSQL
- This project gave us the opportunity to consolidate what we've learnt.

### Challenges faced and features I hope to implement in the future:   
**Challenges:**
- the login feature proved to be a challenge to implement

**For extra functionality/features, I could include:**   
...

## How to install and run the project:
1. Open files in editor e.g. Visual Studio Code
2. ...
3. In the project directory, run: `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
